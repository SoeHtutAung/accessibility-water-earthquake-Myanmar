# Catchment area and population coverage of water treatment plants
The purpose is to support post-disaster humanitarian assistance by estimating catchment area and population coverage of water treatment plants, donated by TSBM as response to 2025 Myanmar earthquake. In this analysis, we emphasize on wards in Sagaing township and selected townships of Mandalay region, and at township-level in Amarapura and Tada-U townships. Public version of the outputs could be seen in this [Canva](https://soehtutaung.my.canva.site/tsbm-wtp-access) site.

## 1. Data extraction
Following data are extracted
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| ward.geojson </br> township.geojson | Spatial dataset from the [MIMU](https://geonode.themimu.info/layers/) |
| mmi_mean.flt </br> mmi_mean.hdr | Raster surface from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/shakemap/metadata)|
| mmr_pd_2020_1km_UNadj.tif | Population density raster surface (2020 UN adjusted) from [Worldpop](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=77)|

## 2. Categorizing intensity
Modified Mercalli Intensity ([MMI](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/modified-mercalli-intensity-scale)) scale is released by USGS and downloaded from this [link](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/shakemap/metadata). For the purpose of simplification, we simply round the intensity scales into integer and categorize as 'below 7' (weak to strong), 7 (Very strong), 8 (Severe), and 9 (Violent).

## 3. Producing datasets
We rescale the population according to [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&country=MMR)'s estimates for 2023 and projected for 2024 using average population growth rate. Total population and population in each intensity categories are extracted using exactextractr package. Proportion of population who experienced severe (MMI scale - 8) or violent (MMI scale - 9) for each township is used to display in the maps.
